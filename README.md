# Ping Pong

Keep the ball inside the boundary of the view.

Use rackets to deflect back the ball.
  - Use 'w' and 's' for moving the left racket up and down respectively.
  - Use 'ArrowUp' and 'ArrowDown' for moving the right racket up and dow respectively.

If the ball hits the left or right wall, game is over.
